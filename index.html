	<!--<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Jonathan McGlone</span> and I make things on the web for academic libraries and scholarly publishers.</p>-->
	<p>
		I am a research scientist at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research">Qualcomm AI Research</a>, living in Amsterdam. 
		Previously, I was an applied scientist at Microsoft in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/about/offices/paddington/">London</a>.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		At Qualcomm, I have worked on 3D Computer Vision topics such as unsupervised positioning that is modality-agnostic and have applied it to WiFi positioning which has been featured at <a href="https://youtu.be/xNmnqCsvMTU">MWC 2021</a>, IEEE Globecom 2021, and <a href="https://youtu.be/8Qu-qVBhKZU">NeurIPS 2021</a>. I am currently working on creating efficient on-device video-denoising algorithms.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		My current research interests include self-supervised learning, positioning, and efficient video architecture design.
